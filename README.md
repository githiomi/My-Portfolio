# Daniel Githiomi's Portfolio

## Description

This is the repository that holds my personal portfolio as a software developer to showcase my projects and what I have been able to develop and accomplish as a software developer.

Highly recommended that upon downloading the zipped contents of the website, one should have XAMPP software pre-installed in their computer and/or device. After unzipping the content, it should all be moved to the ‘htdocs’ directory in C:/Local Disk (C:)/xampp folder as this is the only way to ensure that the .php files are able to run using the dummy server provided by XAMPP.
